                <p class="paragraph"> New York is one of the most cinematographic cities in the world. Its streets, its architecture, the iridescence of Times Square, the fashionable postcards of its people crossing the avenues, Central Park, the mixture of the Bronx, etc.. Directors such as Woddy Allen, Martin Scorsese and Alejandro González Iñárritu are some of those who have tried to capture the atmosphere and the unique spirit of "the capital of the world" in their films. 
                </p>
            <div class="article-paragraphs">
                <p class="paragraph"> Filming in the city, however, is not a simple nor comfortable task. It involves closing streets, diverting traffic and, for many neighbors, it is even an alteration of their daily lives. The latest example of this is what happened with Todd Phillips' new film, Joker. In one of his most iconic scenes, Joaquin Phoenix, who plays the classic villain, dances in the endless stands that are located in the <span class="name"><a href="https://verne.elpais.com/verne/2019/10/23/articulo/1571842916_209686.html">Bronx.</a></span> That place, which almost nobody used to go through before, is now one of the main destinations for taking photoshoots for Instagram.

            <div class="article-paragraphs">
                <p class="paragraph"> Complicated or not, the truth is that New York will never cease to be seen as an exquisite, cosmopolitan and globalized location for both movies and television series. And the data proves it. Until December of this year, according to data from New York City Open Data, 5,620 filming permits were granted in New York City.

                    </center>

                <p class="paragraph"> In a similar area, the number of permits granted for television series, in the same period of the year, reached 737, which yields a not entirely surprising fact: the supremacy of the film industry over that of the television service.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph"> Now, taking a closer look at the results by zip code, there are interesting, eloquent and logical details. The area with the most general filming (television and cinema) during 2019 was Greenpoint (ZIP Code 11 222), in Brooklyn. This is not far-fetched at all if you consider that this is an area where you can see one of the key social problems in New York in recent years: gentrification.. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph"> Greenpoint is the very representation of the term 'hípster': underground bars, artisan breweries, vinyl record stores, food from all over the world, local vegetable fair and an infinite etcetera. Among the films that have shot part of their scenes here are The Departed, The Siege and the hilarious Anger Management. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">In the field of films themselves, on the other hand, the favorite place for directors is Williamsburg, also in Brooklyn. In fact, it borders on Greenpoint. And the tone of this area, of course, is the same: sites designed for walkers and millennial tourists to capture their best photos for Instagram.
                </p>
                <div>
                   <center>
                    <iframe title="Feature film permits in 2019" aria-label="USA new york city zip codes choropleth map" id="datawrapper-chart-0R1el" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0R1el/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>
                    </center>
                <p class="paragraph"> The question that arises then is: if the cameras come to your neighborhood, is it because gentrification has finished settling? And more: who really benefits from this? The city? The industry? The neighbors?
